            <p>In an attempt to gather knowledge throughout my life, i love to explore. However, in my case, the exploration is limited to whatever books i can get my hands on, whatever vlogs available on the internet and whatever tutorials uploaded on YouTube as i am not able to transcend physical borders yet. Still, this limitation hasn't stopped me from believing in the process of learning. As of now, i consider myself a student of science, mainly physics and mathematics. I also love literary works and have written a few articles and also published a book, so that technically makes me an author as well. 
            <br>

            Apart from my current job as a CTO of PAR Entertainment, I am also a decent front end web developer, the proof of which remains right in front of your eyes i.e this very website, and a few others which i developed. Hence, i am also willing to work for reasonable people at a reasonable price

            <p>In the near future, I plan to pursue physics as my academic and career choice. Currently, i am invested in writing a paper on Thorium based Small Modular Reactors and wish to complete and publish the paper roughly around the end of my undergraduate years. So, any help on this topic will greatly be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Recently, PAR entertainment has become a huge part of my life. A good portion of my time is invested working there. PAR entertainment is a relatively new startup which started in late 2021. Currently, we've only managed to produce a music video however our efforts in expanding and growing this business is as adamant as ever.

        <div class="webdesigner reveal">
            <p>Being a self taught front-end web developer without any official certificate, i am pretty dry in terms of how many jobs i get. Despite that, i've managed to code several static websites including my own and the one under PAR entertainment which comes with the job of being CTO.
